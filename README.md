## About Me

I'm currently a Data Science student at IIT Madras with a background in Philosophy. This unique blend of disciplines drives my interest in exploring the intersections of ethics, language, and artificial intelligence. My journey from studying philosophy to working in data science has profoundly shaped my problem-solving approach, especially within the domains of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Current Focus

- Pursuing a BS in Data Science and Applications at IIT Madras, expected to graduate in 2025
- Contributing to open-source text-to-speech models for Indian languages as part of AI4Bharat’s initiatives
- Deepening my expertise in NLP and LLMs
- Aiming to bridge the gap between machine learning theory and application through research and content development

## Experience Highlights

- Project Associate at AI4Bharat, IIT Madras
- Research Intern in Machine Learning at IIT Madras
- Teaching Assistant for the course *Machine Learning Techniques (CS2007)* at IIT Madras

## Selected Projects

- [Cat Image Classifier](https://github.com/SherryS997/Cat-Image-Classification-Neural-Network-using-NumPy-and-SciPy): Implemented a neural network from scratch using NumPy, focusing on image classification
- [Blog-Lite v2](https://github.com/SherryS997/Blog-Lite-v2): Developed a lightweight blog platform using Vue3 and Flask
- [Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/SherryS997/Machine-Learning-Algorithms): Created a comprehensive repository of foundational machine learning algorithms, now used as a resource by students at IIT Madras

I’m always open to collaboration on projects related to ML, NLP, or the ethical aspects of AI. I welcome discussions that push the boundaries of what’s possible in tech and look forward to connecting with others who share similar interests.
