# Hi there! 👋 I'm Sherry Thomas

## About Me

I'm a Data Science student at IIT Madras with a unique background in Philosophy. This combination fuels my passion for exploring the intersection of ethics, language, and artificial intelligence. My journey from philosophy to data science has shaped my approach to problem-solving and my keen interest in NLP and Large Language Models.

## Current Focus

- 🎓 Pursuing a BS in Data Science and Applications at IIT Madras (Expected 2025)
- 🗣️ Working on open-source text-to-speech models for Indian languages at AI4Bhārat
- 🧠 Diving deep into the world of Large Language Models and NLP
- 📊 Bridging the gap between ML theory and practice through research and content creation

## Experience Highlights

- 🔬 Data Science Intern at AI4Bhārat, IIT Madras
- 📚 Machine Learning Research Intern at IIT Madras
- 👨‍🏫 Teaching Assistant for Machine Learning Techniques (CS2007) at IIT Madras

## Projects I'm Proud Of

- 🐱 [Cat Image Classifier](https://github.com/SherryS997/Cat-Image-Classification-Neural-Network-using-NumPy-and-SciPy): Built a neural network from scratch using NumPy
- ✍️ [Blog-Lite v2](https://github.com/SherryS997/Blog-Lite-v2): Award-winning blog platform using Vue3 and Flask
